It is a graphically enhanced version of the game with improved sound effects, textures, and lighting.

Popular Game Modes
The game offers two main game modes: Battle Royale and Clash Squad. In Battle Royale, 50 players are taken to an island and must fight to be the last survivor. On the other hand, Clash Squad is a team-based mode in which two teams of four players each face off in a best-of-five match. Meanwhile, Free Fire offers a variety of items, weapons, and vehicles that players can use to survive. The game also features a system of playable characters with unique abilities.

Gameplay
Players control a character from a third-person perspective in Free Fire. So, you can shoot and throw objects using the fire button. The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, and lying down. During gameplay, players can use the ‚ÄúGloo Wall‚Äù grenade as cover to protect themselves from harm.

Game modes
Free Fire offers over 15 game modes, such as Team Deathmatch, Clash Squad, Big Head, Explosive Jump, Cold Steel, Zombie Hunt, Rampage, and Pet Mania. However, aside from Battle Royale, Clash Squad, and Lone Wolf, most modes are only accessible during special events.
